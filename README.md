# Analytic Story Execution (ASX)
![](static/appIconAlt_2x.png)
----

##Description: 
This application gives you the tools to make the execution of an Analytic Story in Splunk an automated process. It's as easy as selecting an Analytic Story and clicking "Submit!"

**Benefit:** Instead of running each search individually, analysts can use this app to execute an Analytic Story end-to-end in their environments.

**Value:** Security analysts gain use-case relevant context and correlation when detection events are generated and can automatically trigger the investigative searches from that analytic story to bring back more information about the triggered detection

----


##Tools:

There are two custom commands in this app that will help you automatically detect and investigate scenarios in your dataset:

1. detect
2. investigate

----

**detect:** 
This is a [Custom Search Generating command](https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/developapps/customsearchcommands/) that runs all baseline and detection searches in an Analytic Story. 

Syntax:```
| detect story="<analytic_story_name>" | `format_detection_results`
```


Example:```
| detect story="Malicious Powershell" | `format_detection_results`
```

***Note**: The `format_detection_results` is a macro that leveraged to format the detection results for friendly display of field names.

**investigate**
This is a [Custom Search Streaming command](https://dev.splunk.com/enterprise/docs/developapps/customsearchcommands/) that runs all investigative searches on all the `entities` generated using the `detect` command.

Syntax:```
| detect story="<analytic_story_name>" 
| `format_detection_results` | investigate
```


Example:```
| detect story="Malicious Powershell" | `format_detection_results`| investigate
```

***Note**:  investigate is a streaming command and can be executed after "Detect.
